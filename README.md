# Python Neural Network only using NumPy
A Neural Network written in Python without the use of any ML libraries, so only NumPy. It will be trained on the [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?resource=download) dataset, but in csv format, because it is much easier to use.

## Requirements 
The requirements for the project are:
* numpy 
* pandas

They can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

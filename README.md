# Python Neural Network only using NumPy
A Neural Network written in Python without the use of any ML libraries, so only NumPy. It will be trained on the [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?resource=download) dataset, but in csv format, because it is much easier to use.
